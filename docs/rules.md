# Game Rules

## Setup

- At least 4 players are required.
- One player will be the Assassin, the other 3 players are Innocent.
- There are 25 emoji tiles to choose from.

## Overall Game Flow

Each round of the game follows these steps:

1. Choosing Secrets / Placing the Bomb
    - Innocent players select a tile to be their Secret tile
    - The Assassin selects a tile to be the Bomb tile
2. Search for the Assassin
    - Players are shown their Secret tile and a number of Safe tiles. Safe tiles do not contain the bomb.
    - Players take turns selecting tiles
    - Scores are tracked behind the scenes (as to not give away the assassin)
    - If a player selects the bomb, they are out of this round. Return to step 1.
    - If there is just one Innocent player remaining with the Assassin, the Assassin wins the round.
3. Voting
    - Players can call a vote to attempt to find the Assassin. Only active players may vote.
    - If an Innocent player is voted out, they are out of this round, putting the Assassin one step closer to winning.
    - If the Assassin is voted out, the Innocent players win the round.
4. Showdown
    - If the number of tiles is equal to the number of players, Showdown starts.
    - All players have 10 seconds to simultaneously select their final tile.
    - Players can see where other players are going.
    - Players may change their decision up until the end of the 10-second time limit.
5. Round scores are tallied as follows at the end of a round:
    - Innocent Players:
      - Selecting a plain tile: 1 point, plus 1 point for every 5 tiles removed from the board already (e.g. if the game starts with 25 tiles, a plain tile scores 2 points if there are 20 tiles remaining and 5 points if there are 5 or fewer tiles remaining).
      - Selecting the Bomb: 20 points for the Assassin
      - Winning the round: ALL innocent players get 30 points
    - Assassin:
      - Selecting a plain tile: 1 point, always (they're not at risk of hitting the bomb!)
      - Selecting the Bomb: -20 points for the Assassin
      - Winning the round: 
    - All Players:
      - Selecting a Safe tile belonging to another player: plain tile scoring for the active player, 2 points for the owning player
      - Selecting a Favorite tile belonging to another Innocent player: 5 points for the owning player
